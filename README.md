These are the codes for the paper "Shaping dynamics with multiple populations in low-rank recurrent networks".

All figures of the publication can be reproduced by running the respective script. They take only a few seconds to run.

Figure 7 includes some summary statistics (panels B, C and D) that take longer to run (~1h). The file "C_Fig7_allpanels.py" plots those panels based on a saved file (also provided). The file "C_Fig7_ABCD.py", which takes longer to run, calculates those summary statistics.
